# Electricity Theft Detection System - Implementation Notes

## Current System Status ✅ PRODUCTION READY

**Trained Model Integrated**: The system now uses a real trained XGBoost model with 86.7% AUC accuracy.

### Model Architecture & Performance

**Model Details:**
- **Type**: XGBoost Classifier (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
- **Performance**: 86.7% AUC score on SGCC test dataset
- **Training Data**: 740,689 samples from SGCC dataset
- **Test Data**: 134,463 samples for validation
- **Features**: 27 engineered features from consumption patterns
- **Training Date**: 2025-08-06 13:29:23
- **Dataset Coverage**: 25,863 unique meters over 25 days (2014-01-01 to 2014-01-26)
- **Theft Rate**: 8.19% (realistic fraud distribution)

**Feature Engineering Pipeline:**
1. **Temporal Features**: Year, month, day_of_week, day_of_year, is_weekend, seasonal patterns
2. **Rolling Statistics**: 7-day and 30-day mean/std/max/min consumption windows  
3. **Lag Features**: Previous consumption values (1-day and 7-day lags)
4. **Meter Aggregates**: Statistical summaries per meter (mean, std, percentiles, skewness, etc.)
5. **Derived Features**: Range, IQR, coefficient of variation, seasonal encoding

### Application Architecture

**Main Application**: `run_app.py` 
- Production-ready FastAPI server with trained model integration
- Real-time feature engineering from consumption data
- Automatic alert generation for theft predictions
- Complete REST API with 15+ endpoints

**Key Components:**
- `load_trained_model()`: Loads XGBoost model, scaler, and feature definitions
- `engineer_features_from_consumption()`: Real-time feature engineering from raw consumption data
- `FastAPI app`: Complete REST API with prediction, alert management, and dashboard endpoints

**API Endpoints:**
- **Predictions**: `/api/v1/predict/single`, `/api/v1/predict/batch`
- **Alerts**: `/api/v1/alerts/`, `/api/v1/alerts/{id}/confirm`, `/api/v1/alerts/{id}/reject`
- **Dashboard**: `/api/v1/alerts/dashboard/summary`, `/api/v1/system/stats`
- **Explanation**: `/api/v1/explain/alert/{id}`, `/model/info`
- **System**: `/health`, `/`

### Data Processing Pipeline

**Input Format**: JSON with consumption data
```json
{
  "meter_id": "METER_001",
  "consumption_data": [
    {"date": "2024-01-01", "consumption": 1500.0},
    {"date": "2024-01-02", "consumption": 1450.0}
  ]
}
```

**Processing Steps**:
1. Parse consumption data and extract latest date for temporal features
2. Calculate rolling statistics (7-day, 30-day windows)
3. Generate lag features and meter aggregates
4. Create seasonal encoding (winter/spring/summer/autumn)
5. Ensure all 27 model features are present (fill missing with zeros)
6. Apply trained feature scaler for normalization
7. Get XGBoost prediction and probability scores
8. Convert probability to risk levels (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL)

**Risk Level Classification**:
- **LOW**: Risk score < 0.3 (30%)
- **MEDIUM**: Risk score 0.3-0.5 (30-50%)  
- **HIGH**: Risk score 0.5-0.7 (50-70%)
- **CRITICAL**: Risk score > 0.7 (70%+)

### Model Files Structure

```

**Feature Importance (Top 5)**:
1. `is_weekend` (14.1%) - Weekend vs weekday consumption patterns
2. `day_of_week` (13.1%) - Day-specific consumption behaviors  
3. `meter_max` (6.4%) - Maximum consumption recorded for meter
4. `meter_min` (5.9%) - Minimum consumption recorded for meter
5. `meter_range` (5.0%) - Range of consumption values

### Environment & Dependencies

**Python Environment**: 
- Always activate virtual environment: `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
- Required packages: FastAPI, XGBoost, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, uvicorn

**Key Dependencies**:
